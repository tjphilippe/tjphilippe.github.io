<!-- <!doctype html>
 an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in 
this declaration specifies HTML5
-->

<!--
The <html> tag tells the browser that this is an HTML document.

The <html> tag represents the root of an HTML document.

The <html> tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the <!DOCTYPE> tag) -->

<!--<manifest> HTML5 introduces application cache, which means that a web application is cached, and accessible without an internet connection.

Application cache gives an application three advantages:

Offline browsing - users can use the application when they're offline
Speed - cached resources load faster
Reduced server load - the browser will only download updated/changed resources from the server

-->


<!--
The <link> tag defines a link between a document and an external resource.

The <link> tag is used to link to external style sheets.

Note: The <link> element is an empty element, it contains attributes only.

Note: This element goes only in the head section, but it can appear any number of times.

<!--
Metadata is data (information) about data.

The <meta> tag provides metadata about the HTML document. Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but will be machine parsable.

Meta elements are typically used to specify page description, keywords, author of the document, last modified, and other metadata.

The metadata can be used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), or other web services.

 Note: <meta> tags always goes inside the <head> element.

Note: Metadata is always passed as name/value pairs.

Note: The content attribute MUST be defined if the name or the http-equiv attribute is defined. If none of these are defined, the content attribute CANNOT be defined.

Example 1 - Define keywords for search engines:

<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, XML, XHTML, JavaScript">
Example 2 - Define a description of your web page:

<meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials on HTML and CSS">
Example 3 - Define the author of a page:

<meta name="author" content="Hege Refsnes">
Example 4 - Refresh document every 30 seconds:

<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">

charset	character_set	Specifies the character encoding for the HTML document
content	text	Gives the value associated with the http-equiv or name attribute
http-equiv	content-type
default-style
refresh	Provides an HTTP header for the information/value of the content attribute

Specifies the character encoding for the HTML document.
Common values:

UTF-8 - Character encoding for Unicode
ISO-8859-1 - Character encoding for the Latin alphabet
In theory, any character encoding can be used, but no browser understands all of them. The more widely a character encoding is used, the better the chance that a browser will understand it.-->

<head>
The <head> element is a container for all the head elements.

The <head> element can include a title for the document, scripts, styles, meta information, and more.

The following elements can go inside the <head> element:

<title> (this element is required in an HTML document)
<style>
<base>
The <base> tag specifies the base URL/target for all relative URLs in a document.

There can be at maximum one <base> element in a document, and it must be inside the <head> element.
Tip: Put the <base> tag as the first element inside the <head> element, so that other elements in the head section uses the information from the <base> element.

Note: If the <base> tag is present, it must have either an href attribute or a target attribute, or both
<link>
<meta>
<script>
<noscript>
